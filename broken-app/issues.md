# Broken App Issues

Improved variable syntax to follow prefered syntax (let to const, var to const)

Included a console.log message on app.list

Placed app.js in the root directory of project

Changed function to a shorthand for conciseness

Created new Error class to identify missing refrence error for next(err)

Created an app.get route that returns json of user containing D in axios

Changed post route to conatin a promise all and for loop that itereates D. instead of the string template litteral. which will then push the data into json
